# water-level-detector
This project is a water level detector made as a first-year college project (Semester 1, 2023). It uses an Arduino and a rain sensor to monitor water levels in real time. The system provides alerts at specific thresholds via an LED or buzzer, making it a compact solution for basic water level monitoring. Ideal for beginner Arduino enthusiasts.
